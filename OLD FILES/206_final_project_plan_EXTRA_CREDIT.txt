SI 206 Final Project Plan: Winter 2017
Option #2: Twitter and OMDB

Potential Functions to Create:

** def cacheData()

INPUT: none
 
PURPOSE: CACHING DATA

RETURNS: nothing

** def getTwitterData(twitter_user) **

INPUT: Twitter Handle

PURPOSE: Makes call to Tweepy API for Tweets published by the Twitter User based on the handle

RETURNS: JSON Object to be used later for extracting data

** def getOMDBdata(search_term) **

INPUT: Search Term (movies/actors/etc)

PURPOSE: Makes call to the OMDB API based on the search parameters. Still needs to read up on API Documentation. 

API Documentation: http://www.omdbapi.com/

RETURNS: JSON Object to be used later for extracting data

** class Movie(self, OMDB_object = {}) **

This will be a class for all the attributes based on the movie.

INPUT: the JSON object that is extracted from the getOMDB data

RETURNS: String Method of maybe the Movie, Year, and Actor

CONSTRUCTOR: defines all of the self.X variables to be used for futher methods in the class Movie. 

We will use the JSON file object that is inputted to extract the title, director, IMDB rating, listing of actors, number of languages, and their Rotten Tomatoes rating.


Methods can Include returning each of the elements. One of the methods can create a tuple that will be used to put into a database in later code. More methods will be TBD.


** class Tweet(self, Twitter_object = {}) **

This will be a class for a simple Tweet.
Will be very similar to the Movie class



More Functions and things will be done TBD
